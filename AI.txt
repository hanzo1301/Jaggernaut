Please replace "path_to_dataset_directory" with the actual path to your dataset directory containing subdirectories for each class of images. This code assumes that the dataset directory structure follows the format mentioned in the article.

This code performs the following steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Load a pre-trained ResNet50 model without the top classification layer.
Add a custom classification head to the ResNet50 model.
Compile and train the model.
Evaluate the model on the test set and print the test accuracy.
Plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs.
